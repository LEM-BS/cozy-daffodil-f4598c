<h2>Who It’s For &amp; Why It’s Popular</h2>
<p>The Level 2 HomeBuyer Report is technically suitable for properties built after 1945 using traditional materials. However, it’s most commonly chosen for homes built after 1945, when construction methods became more standardised—such as cavity walls, timber roofs, and suspended floors. It’s ideal for properties in generally reasonable condition that haven’t been significantly altered.</p>
<p> It offers a balance of detail, affordability, and practical advice—helping buyers spot issues, budget for future repairs, and avoid hidden costs.</p>

<li>Identification of significant defects and maintenance risks</li>
<li>Advice on repairs and prioritised maintenance</li>

</ul>
