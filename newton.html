      <h2>Your Independent Newton Surveyor</h2>
      <p>
        Newton offers a range of 20th-century homes, traditional terraces, and family semis near schools and parks. Whether you’re buying a modernised semi or an older brick-built property, I provide reliable, qualified survey reports that make sense.

        <li><strong>Level 1 RICS Condition Report:</strong> For newer or well-maintained homes needing a basic condition summary.</li>

        <li><strong>Level 3 Building Survey:</strong> For older, extended or altered homes — includes structural elements and detailed commentary.</li>
        <li><strong>Damp & Timber Surveys:</strong> Thorough inspections of moisture or wood-related issues, with impartial advice.</li>
