<h2>Your Independent Newton Surveyor</h2>
<p>
        Newton offers a range of 20th-century homes, traditional terraces, and family semis near schools and parks. Whether you’re buying a modernised semi or an older brick-built property, I provide reliable, qualified survey reports that make sense.
      </p>
<h2>Available Surveys</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1 RICS Condition Report:</strong> For newer or well-maintained homes needing a basic condition summary.</li>
<li><strong>Level 2 HomeBuyer Report:</strong> Most popular choice — defect identification with repair and maintenance advice.</li>
<li><strong>Level 3 Building Survey:</strong> For older, extended or altered homes — includes structural elements and detailed commentary.</li>
<li><strong>Damp &amp; Timber Surveys:</strong> Thorough inspections of moisture or wood-related issues, with impartial advice.</li>
<li><strong>Measured Surveys:</strong> Floorplans and spatial layouts for planning or documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Ventilation Reports:</strong> For condensation, air quality, or mould problems — ideal for buyers or landlords.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Local Knowledge:</strong> I know the property types, issues, and building stock common to Newton and North Chester.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Contact:</strong> No call centres or sales teams — you deal directly with me, Liam (AssocRICS).</li>
<li><strong>Prompt Reports:</strong> Reports usually delivered in 3–5 working days, often sooner.</li>
