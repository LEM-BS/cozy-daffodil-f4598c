<h2>Your Local Aldford Surveyor</h2>
<p>
        With its characterful cottages, large country homes and rural setting, Aldford properties deserve the attention of a qualified local surveyor. I offer a personal, AssocRICS-accredited service with expert insights tailored to the construction types common across the area.
      </p>
<h2>Available Survey Types</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>RICS Level 1 Condition Report:</strong> A basic condition overview for newer, well-maintained properties.</li>
<li><strong>RICS Level 2 HomeBuyer Report:</strong> Highlights key defects, repair needs and maintenance advice for standard homes.</li>
<li><strong>RICS Level 3 Building Survey:</strong> A deep-dive into structure, materials, alterations, and future repairs—ideal for older or non-standard homes.</li>
<li><strong>Damp &amp; Timber Reports:</strong> Identify causes of moisture, decay or mould, with clear recommendations.</li>
<li><strong>Ventilation &amp; Condensation Assessments:</strong> Investigate airflow issues contributing to poor indoor air quality or persistent damp.</li>
