      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>What’s the difference between a Level 2 and Level 3 survey?</summary>
        <p><strong>Level 2 (HomeBuyer Report):</strong> Ideal for standard, modern homes. Offers a visual inspection, identifies urgent defects, and includes practical advice.</p>
        <p><strong>Level 3 (Building Survey):</strong> Designed for older, extended, or non-standard properties. It provides in-depth analysis of structure, defects, and repairs.</p>

      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How long does a home survey take?</summary>
        <p>Most inspections take 2–4 hours, depending on size and condition. Reports are typically delivered within 3–5 working days.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do I need a damp & timber survey on a newer property?</summary>
        <p>If you see any signs of moisture, musty smells, or mould—even in new homes—it’s wise to get a targeted damp & timber inspection.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Are your reports RICS-compliant?</summary>
        <p>Yes. All surveys follow the latest <strong>RICS Home Survey Standard</strong> to ensure accuracy, transparency, and consistency across every report.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What areas do you cover?</summary>

      </details>

      <h2>Buyer Advice</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>When should I arrange a survey?</summary>
        <p>Book after your offer is accepted but before you exchange contracts. That gives you time to act on any issues found.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What will the report include?</summary>
        <p>Each report highlights urgent repairs, hidden issues, structural concerns, and next steps—clearly laid out and jargon-free.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Should I still get a survey for a "good condition" or newer property?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Even well-maintained or new homes can hide costly issues. For a light-touch check, <a href="/level-1.html">explore our Level 1 Survey →</a></p>
