      <p>When you’re buying a property—especially in today’s market—it’s easy to focus on surface features: the kitchen, the layout, the location. But beneath those first impressions could be costly problems. That’s where a RICS Home Survey comes in.</p>

      <p>At LEM Building Surveying Ltd, we help homebuyers across Chester, Wrexham, Flintshire and surrounding areas uncover the full picture before committing to what’s likely their biggest investment.</p>

      <h2>1. Structural Issues</h2>
      <p>From cracked walls to movement in the foundations, a RICS survey can identify signs of structural defects that may not be obvious during viewings. Catching these early can help you avoid huge repair costs—or give you the power to renegotiate.</p>

      <h2>2. Damp, Timber Decay & Mould</h2>
      <p>Our surveys include assessments for rising damp, penetrating damp, and signs of timber decay such as wet rot, dry rot, and woodworm. Mould and ventilation problems are also flagged—essential for both your health and the integrity of the home.</p>

      <h2>3. Roofing & External Defects</h2>
      <p>Loose tiles, failing flashing, sagging gutters or flat roofs with poor drainage—these can all lead to future water ingress and expensive fixes. Your survey will highlight these risks before they escalate.</p>

      <h2>4. Windows, Doors & Insulation</h2>
      <p>We check for signs of condensation, frame movement, draughts, or poor insulation around openings. Energy efficiency isn’t just about comfort—it can affect your bills and resale value.</p>

      <h2>5. Risks You Can’t See on the Surface</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Inaccessible loft spaces</li>
        <li>Hidden damp behind furniture or paint</li>
        <li>Outdated or dangerous electrics</li>
        <li>Poor ventilation in roof spaces or extensions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your survey will assess as much as can be seen—and clearly flag any limitations.</p>

      <h2>Why It Matters for Buyers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clarity on what you’re buying</li>
        <li>Confidence to proceed—or walk away</li>
        <li>Control when negotiating price or repairs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many clients save thousands by identifying issues early or adjusting their offer.</p>
