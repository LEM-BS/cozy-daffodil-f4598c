<h2>Our Additional Services</h2>
<p>Beyond our core residential surveys, we offer a range of specialist inspection and reporting services for diverse property needs—from snagging inspections to commercial assessments and landlord reporting.</p>
<h3>New Build Snagging Surveys</h3>
<p>Identify defects and incomplete finishes before your builder’s warranty expires. Ideal for buyers of new homes seeking peace of mind and leverage for rectifications.</p>
<h3>Commercial Surveys</h3>
<p>Detailed reports for shops, offices, industrial units and commercial properties. Includes condition assessments, pre-acquisition surveys and planned maintenance support.</p>
<h3>Landlord Inspections</h3>
<p>Independent property checks for landlords to ensure tenant safety, condition compliance and documentation for insurance or lettings purposes.</p>
<h3>Buy-to-Let Surveys</h3>
<p>Concise surveys tailored for investors and landlords evaluating property condition, potential risks and rental suitability.</p>
<h3>Schedules of Condition</h3>
<p>Essential for leases and construction works—capture a property's pre-occupation state to avoid costly disputes at lease end or contract completion.</p>
<h3>Fire Door Surveys</h3>
<p>Ensure doors are compliant, safe and properly installed. Visual inspections and reporting aligned with current fire safety regulations.</p>
<h3>Fire Compartmentation</h3>
