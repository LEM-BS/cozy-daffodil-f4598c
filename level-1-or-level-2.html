<h1>Do I Need a Level 1 or Level 2 Survey?</h1>
<p><strong>Helping You Choose the Right Survey for Peace of Mind</strong></p>
<p>If you're buying a modern property and want to understand its condition before committing, you may be wondering whether a <strong>Level 1 Condition Report</strong> or a <strong>Level 2 HomeBuyer Report</strong> is more suitable.</p>
<p>At LEM Building Surveying Ltd, we guide clients across Chester, Wrexham, Flintshire and beyond in choosing the right survey—based on their needs, budget, and the property's condition.</p>
<h2>What Is a Level 1 Condition Report?</h2>
<p>A Level 1 survey is the most basic RICS survey available. It provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A visual inspection of the property's main elements</li>
<li>Traffic light ratings for condition (green, amber, red)</li>
<li>Identification of urgent or significant issues</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> No advice on repairs or ongoing maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best For:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New-builds or nearly new properties</li>
<li>Homes with no visible defects</li>
<li>Buyers who just want a general snapshot before proceeding</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Is a Level 2 HomeBuyer Report?</h2>
<p>A Level 2 survey is the most commonly chosen report for conventional homes. It includes everything in Level 1, plus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commentary on the condition of key building elements</li>
<li>Notes on repairs, risks, and potential hidden defects</li>
<li>Advice on maintenance and next steps</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best For:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Properties built after 1900</li>
<li>Homes that appear in decent condition but haven’t been recently renovated</li>
<li>Buyers who want a clearer understanding of the building’s performance</li>
</ul>
