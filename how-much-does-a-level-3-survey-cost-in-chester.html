      <h1>How Much Does a Level 3 Survey Cost in Chester?</h1>
      <p><strong>Typical costs, what influences the price, and why it’s worth the investment.</strong></p>

      <p>If you're buying a property in Chester and need a comprehensive inspection, a <a href="/level-3.html">RICS Level 3 Building Survey</a> offers the deepest analysis. But how much should you expect to pay?</p>

      <h2>Average Level 3 Survey Fees in Chester</h2>
      <p>For most homes in Chester, Level 3 survey prices start from around £700 and can exceed £1,200 for large or complex properties. Factors that affect the fee include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Size and age of the property</li>
        <li>Construction type and any extensions</li>
        <li>Specific issues such as damp, timber decay, or structural movement</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Costs Vary</h2>
      <p>A period townhouse in the city centre requires more time than a modern terrace. At LEM Building Surveying, we tailor each quote to the property so you only pay for the time needed.</p>

      <h2>Value for Money</h2>
      <p>A Level 3 survey can reveal hidden defects that might cost thousands to fix. Investing in a detailed report now can give you leverage to renegotiate or budget for repairs.</p>
